pkgbuilds
==============
My PKGBUILDs for [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/).

Categories
--------------
* aur: Packages maintained on [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) (git submodules)
* fixes: Fixes for non-uptodate packages, not maintained by me
* local: Packages maintained for my own use, which do not warrant an upload to the AUR.
